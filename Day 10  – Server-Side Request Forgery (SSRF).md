# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Day 10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## üß† Focus:
Today, I deep-dived into one of the most **underrated but high-severity vulnerabilities** in web security ‚Äî  
**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**.

I explored how attackers can abuse server-side functionality to send unauthorized requests ‚Äî sometimes to internal services, cloud metadata, or even loop back to the server itself üîÑ.

## üìò What I Learned:

### üö® What is SSRF?
- **SSRF** happens when the server fetches a URL or resource provided by the user, and the attacker manipulates it to access unintended internal services.

### üí£ Impact:
- **Internal network scanning**
- Access to **AWS metadata endpoints** (169.254.169.254)
- Bypass IP-based access controls
- May lead to **RCE**, data leakage, or further pivoting

---

### üîç Key Topics Explored:

#### üß© Common SSRF Attacks
- Against the **server itself** (`http://127.0.0.1`)
- Against **back-end systems** (e.g., `http://internal-api`)

#### üîì Circumventing SSRF Defenses
- üü• Blacklist-based input filters: Bypassed using encoded input, redirect chains
- üü© Whitelist-based filters: Used open redirection to bounce through allowed URLs
- ü™û SSRF via redirect logic

#### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Blind SSRF
- SSRF that **doesn‚Äôt return any visible response**
- Learned how to detect these using **out-of-band tools** like Burp Collaborator and DNS logging

#### üîß Finding Hidden Attack Surface
- URLs hidden in:
  - Request bodies
  - Headers like `Referer`
  - JSON/XML/yaml payloads

## üß™ Labs Solved (PortSwigger ‚Äì Apprentice)

- ‚úÖ **Basic SSRF against the local server**
- ‚úÖ **Basic SSRF against another back-end system**

These beginner-friendly labs were incredibly helpful in demonstrating the **core SSRF flow**.  
The moment I changed the URL parameter to `http://127.0.0.1` and got access to internal data ‚Äî that was üí•.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- üîÅ **Burp Repeater** to manipulate URL-based parameters
- üåê Explored targeting:
  - `http://localhost`
  - `http://169.254.169.254` (cloud metadata endpoint)
- üß† Thought process: Looked for parameters like `?url=`, `?next=`, `?image=` ‚Äî all SSRF-prone

## üí° Key Takeaways

> ‚ÄúJust because the browser can‚Äôt reach it, doesn‚Äôt mean the **server** can‚Äôt.‚Äù  
> SSRF is all about **thinking like the server** ‚Äî and that shift in mindset is critical for deeper exploitation.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Struggles

- At first, it was hard to **mentally visualize** that the request is **sent by the server**, not the browser.
- Took a few tries to understand why some SSRF payloads don‚Äôt return any output (blind SSRF).
- Played around with different internal IP ranges and localhost shortcuts to see which are blocked or filtered.
