# Week 6  – 🕵️‍♂️ Discovery and Reporting of a Real-World Security Vulnerability



## **🚀 Scenario & Journey**

This week marked a significant milestone in my bug bounty journey. After weeks of learning about web security concepts, CORS, and API behavior, I finally attempted my **first real-world submission**. ✨

The process started with careful reconnaissance and understanding of how modern web applications communicate with their backend APIs. I noticed an interesting behavior in one of the target applications that indicated a potential misconfiguration. While the issue seemed subtle, I realized its potential impact on the security of users if exploited. ⚠️

## **⚔️ Challenges Faced**

* **Understanding the vulnerability context:** Being a beginner, I initially struggled to differentiate between theoretical learning and practical, real-world scenarios. 🤔
* **PoC creation:** I had to figure out how to demonstrate the vulnerability safely and professionally without touching sensitive user data. 🔒
* **Domain & hosting confusion:** At first, I thought I needed a complex hosting setup to simulate the attack. This caused some hesitation and trial-and-error experimentation. 🏗️
* **HackerOne submission nuances:** Learning how to structure the report, choose the correct asset, and articulate the impact in a clear, professional way was a challenge. 📝

Despite these hurdles, I was able to work through them with research, guidance, and practical testing in a controlled environment. 💪

## **🧠 Knowledge Gained**

* **Deep understanding of CORS and API behavior:** I now have a much better grasp of how cross-origin requests work, how misconfigurations occur, and the potential implications. 🌐
* **Professional reporting skills:** I learned how to structure a bug bounty report, categorize the issue, explain its impact, and present it in a professional manner for triage. 🏆
* **Problem-solving mindset:** Encountering obstacles with domain setup, PoC creation, and report submission taught me resilience and creative thinking. 💡
* **Ethical hacking practice:** I reinforced the importance of testing vulnerabilities **safely**, without causing harm to real users or systems. 🛡️

## **🔑 Importance of the Bug**

While I cannot disclose technical specifics here, this type of vulnerability is critical because it **can expose sensitive information if left unchecked**. For the organization, identifying and fixing such issues strengthens the security posture and protects users. 🏢🔐

For me as a learner, discovering and reporting it has been an invaluable hands-on experience — bridging the gap between theory and practice. 🎓

## **💡 Reflection & Takeaways**

* Bug bounty hunting is as much about **thinking like an attacker** as it is about **communicating professionally**. 🕵️‍♀️📝
* Challenges and roadblocks are opportunities to **learn, adapt, and grow**. 🌱
* Practical experience with real targets, even in a controlled and ethical manner, builds confidence and skill much faster than theoretical exercises alone. ⚡
* Submitting my first report has given me motivation to continue exploring more complex vulnerabilities and improving my reporting quality. 🔥

This week has been a **defining moment** in my journey, reinforcing my passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I am proud of the progress I made and excited to continue documenting and learning in the weeks to come. 🎯
