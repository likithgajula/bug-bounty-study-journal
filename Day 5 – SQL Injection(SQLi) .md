# ðŸ’‰ Day 5 â€“ SQL Injection (SQLi) Theory + Beginner Labs (PortSwigger)

## âœ… What I Did Today

Today, I focused on mastering the fundamentals of **SQL Injection (SQLi)** â€” one of the most powerful vulnerabilities in web security. I studied the **complete theory** of SQLi using PortSwiggerâ€™s learning materials and reinforced the concepts through **beginner labs**.

### ðŸ“š Theory Covered (PortSwigger Academy)

- âœ… What is SQL Injection?  
- âœ… Impact of SQLi on application logic and data confidentiality  
- âœ… How to detect SQLi vulnerabilities:
  - In different parts of the query (WHERE, ORDER BY, etc.)
  - In different contexts (strings, numbers, logic)
- âœ… Real-world examples of SQLi exploitation:
  - Retrieving hidden data  
  - Subverting application logic  
  - Accessing data from other tables  
  - Blind SQLi  
  - Second-order SQLi  
- âœ… Database fingerprinting techniques:
  - Determining DB type and version  
  - Listing tables and columns  
- âœ… UNION attacks:
  - Finding number of columns  
  - Identifying data types  
  - Retrieving interesting data  
- âœ… Blind SQL Injection:
  - Triggering conditional responses  
  - Using errors to infer data  
  - Time-based techniques  
  - Out-of-band (OAST) attacks  
- âœ… Prevention strategies:
  - Parameterized queries  
  - Input validation  
  - Least privilege access to databases

### ðŸ§ª Practical Labs Completed

| Lab Title | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| SQL injection in WHERE clause (retrieving hidden data) | âœ… Solved |
| SQL injection login bypass | âœ… Solved |

Both labs were from the **Apprentice track** on PortSwigger, and they helped reinforce the theory I learned today.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- SQLi can be simple yet devastating â€” even a basic injection can leak sensitive data or bypass login.
- Understanding query structure and context (e.g. string vs numeric) is critical for crafting payloads that work.
- Hints and solutions are valuable tools â€” they accelerate learning when you're just starting.
- I now feel confident in **identifying basic SQLi flaws**, and ready to move into more advanced attacks like UNION and blind SQL injection in the coming days.

## ðŸ§± Struggles & Errors Faced

- As it was my first exposure to SQLi exploitation, crafting payloads like `' OR 1=1--` and understanding how they alter query logic took a few tries.
- **I used the hints and solutions** provided by PortSwigger to solve both labs, which helped me grasp the attacker mindset and decode how SQL queries are built.
- UNION attacks, blind SQLi, and database enumeration still feel a bit abstract â€” I plan to revisit those when I practice the intermediate/advanced labs.
