# 📓 Week 3 – Setting Up for Real-World Bug Hunting (Life + Small Progress)

---

## 🔎 Progress This Week:

Although this week was a bit slow on the technical front due to college starting, personal commitments, moving back to the hostel, I still made sure to take a small but important step towards **real-world bug bounty**.

Here’s what I managed this week:

---

## ✅ What I Did:
- 🐞 **Created my Bugcrowd and HackerOne accounts.**
- 🔍 **Explored HackerOne programs:**
    - Understood how to pick programs based on scope, reward structure, and my current skillset.
    - Learned how to read and analyze program policies, scopes, and exclusions.

## 📺 Resources I Followed:
- [How to Choose Bug Bounty Programs on HackerOne (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/6eYh4yXO-tk?si=OzJufOe559jR5r8V)  
    - This video really helped clarify how HackerOne works, how to analyze programs, and how to approach targets logically.

## 🧠 What I Learned / Realized:
- Bug bounty platforms like **HackerOne and Bugcrowd** aren’t just about technical skills — reading scopes carefully and choosing programs wisely matters a lot.
- Realized that **it's okay if some weeks aren't productive technically** — consistency matters more.
- **Balancing life + college + bug bounty learning** takes conscious effort.

## 💭 Why This Week Still Matters:
Even though I didn’t dive into deep technical learning this week, this step brings me **one step closer to practicing in the real world**.

Sometimes **setting up the foundation** is part of the journey too.
