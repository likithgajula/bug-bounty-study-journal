 # üìÅ Day 09: File Upload Vulnerabilities

## üîç Focus Area:
Today was all about one of the most **critical and impactful bug types** ‚Äî  
**File Upload Vulnerabilities**, with a deep focus on how **unvalidated uploads** can lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** üíÄ

This was a massive eye-opener ‚Äî a simple image upload feature, if misconfigured, can turn into a full-blown entry point for attackers.

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

### üìÇ What are File Upload Vulnerabilities?
- Vulnerabilities that arise when a server **accepts uploaded files without proper validation**, allowing malicious files like `.php` or `.jsp` to slip through.

### üí• Impact:
- **Complete server compromise** via uploaded shells
- **Stored XSS** through malicious scripts
- Bypassing filters and blacklists

### üß† Core Concepts Explored:
- How web servers handle **static file requests**
- MIME type spoofing and **Content-Type header manipulation**
- Blacklist vs. whitelist-based validation
- Uploading via **PUT requests**
- How some vulnerabilities can be exploited **even without code execution** (e.g., client-side JS injection or parser exploitation)

## üß™ Labs Completed (PortSwigger ‚Äì Apprentice)

- ‚úÖ **Remote code execution via web shell upload**
- ‚úÖ **Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass**

Both were incredibly hands-on. The moment I got a shell uploaded and hit it in the browser ‚Äî that "‚ö°Ô∏èit works!" feeling was awesome.  
Changing the `Content-Type` header in Burp Repeater to sneak past weak checks gave me a better understanding of how easily defenses can be bypassed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- üîß **Burp Suite Repeater**
  - Modified request headers like `Content-Type` and filename extensions
- üß† Learned how to use:
  - `.php.jpg`, `.php;.jpg`, `.php%00.jpg`
  - PUT method uploads
  - Spoofed file contents to trick servers
- üóÇÔ∏è Practiced static content access behavior using fake image uploads

## üéØ Key Takeaway

> ‚ÄúFile upload feels innocent‚Ä¶ until you realize it‚Äôs the fastest path to a reverse shell.‚Äù  

<p>Learning how <b>tiny oversights in upload logic</b> can let attackers take over a server really showed me why this is considered a <b>high-severity, high-bounty</b> bug.</p>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Struggles Faced

- Understanding **how MIME type checks work** internally took a bit of time.
- It was confusing at first how **some extensions are allowed**, but still get executed based on server-side misconfig.
- Tried experimenting with **blacklisting edge cases** (e.g., `.phP;.jpg`) and noticed how **some labs didn‚Äôt filter capitalized or obfuscated extensions**.
