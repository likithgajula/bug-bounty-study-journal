# üß© Day 07: HTML Injection & CORS Misconfigurations


## üîç Focus Area:
Today's learning focused on two important but often overlooked vulnerabilities:  
- **HTML Injection**: Inserting raw HTML into a web page to manipulate its structure or appearance.  
- **CORS Misconfiguration**: How improperly configured CORS headers can expose sensitive data to untrusted origins.

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

### üß© HTML Injection
- Learned how **HTML Injection** allows attackers to inject raw HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`.
- Practiced injecting these elements into vulnerable forms and observing how they altered the page content.
- Understood how it differs from XSS ‚Äî **HTML Injection doesn't execute JavaScript**, but it can trick users, modify layouts, or deliver phishing payloads.

### üåê CORS Misconfiguration
- Understood the role of **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** and how it controls access between different origins.
- Learned why headers like:
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`  
  can be **dangerous if misused**.

## üß™ Labs & Practice

- ‚úÖ Solved the **CORS Misconfiguration Lab** on PortSwigger using Burp Suite and guidance from the video walkthrough.
- üß† Applied theoretical CORS knowledge in a practical exploitation scenario.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- üîç **Burp Suite** ‚Äì for modifying `Origin` headers and testing misconfigurations
- üåê **PortSwigger Labs** ‚Äì for safe, realistic exploitation

## üß† Key Takeaways

> "Even the most secure-looking applications can fail if a single response header is misconfigured."

Learning CORS and HTML Injection helped me appreciate how **client-side behaviors and server-side controls** must align perfectly to ensure security.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Struggles Faced

- Initially confused CORS with CSRF due to the similar ‚Äúcross-origin‚Äù concept.
- Took time to fully understand the risk of combining wildcard origins (`*`) with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.
- Needed multiple replays of the walkthrough video to understand the exploitation flow step-by-step.
