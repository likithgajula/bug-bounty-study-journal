### ⚠️ Summary:
This week, I couldn’t make meaningful progress in my bug bounty journey. Due to academic priorities and personal time constraints, I was unable to dedicate consistent time for practice or learning. Instead of forcing half-hearted effort, I chose to step back, reflect, and reset.

### 🧭 Reflections:
- Realized the importance of managing energy, not just time.
- Staying consistent with small tasks would’ve helped keep momentum.
- This brief pause reminded me *why* I started — to grow with purpose.

### 💬 One-liner takeaway:
