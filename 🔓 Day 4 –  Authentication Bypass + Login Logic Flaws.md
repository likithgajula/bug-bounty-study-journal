# ðŸ”“ Day 4 â€“ Deep Dive into Authentication Bypass & Login Logic Flaws (PortSwigger Apprentice Labs)

## âœ… What I Did Today

Todayâ€™s focus was on mastering **authentication mechanisms** and uncovering common vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass login systems. Authentication is a critical security layer, and understanding its weaknesses is key to effective bug hunting.

I completed practical, hands-on labs on:

### ðŸ“˜ PortSwigger Web Security Academy:
- Comprehensive concepts of **authentication vs authorization**  
- How **authentication vulnerabilities arise** and their potential impact  
- In-depth exploration of **password-based authentication weaknesses** including:  
  - Brute-force attacks against usernames and passwords  
  - Username enumeration techniques  
  - Common pitfalls in brute-force protections  
  - Exploiting misconfigured HTTP Basic Authentication  
- Examination of **multi-factor authentication (MFA) vulnerabilities** such as bypass and brute forcing 2FA codes  
- Analysis of security flaws in session management, password reset, and password change functionalities  
- Best practices and strategies to **secure authentication workflows**

By applying these concepts in realistic lab environments, I strengthened my ability to identify and exploit subtle authentication flaws, which are often gateways to critical security breaches.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- **Authentication is the front door to any system**; flaws here can lead to total account compromise.  
- **Brute-force and enumeration remain effective attack vectors** without proper rate-limiting and protections.  
- Multi-factor authentication can be defeated if verification logic is weak or improperly implemented.  
- Attackers often target password reset/change flows and session persistence to escalate privileges.  
- Combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on labs is essential for developing real-world exploitation skills.

Iâ€™m excited to continue building on this foundation with more advanced labs and start applying these skills on bug bounty platforms.
